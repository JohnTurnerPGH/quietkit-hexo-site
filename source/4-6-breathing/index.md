<div class="center-all-div" style="margin-top: 90px;"><h1>4-6 Breathing Technique (start here)</h1>**Breathe in sync with this:**

<img src="/img/4-6-breathing-image.gif" width="600px" height="400px" alt="4-6 breathing image, inhale for 4 seconds through your nose, exhale for 6 seconds through your nose" />

</div>

<h2>Quick directions:</h2>

1. Inhale for 4 seconds (as the circle expands) through your nose.
1. Exhale for 6 seconds (as the circle shrinks) through your nose.

Repeat as many times as needed, but also feel free to use this for very short sessions, as you get used to 4-6 breathing.

(will add more to this soon, including tips and tricks to best get started)
