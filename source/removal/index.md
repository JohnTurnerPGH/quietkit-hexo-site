**Breathe in sync with this:**

Box breathing is a technique used to calm yourself down with a simple 4 second rotation of breathing in, holding your breath, breathing out, holding your breath, and repeating.

Use this image to help you keep time! :)

**Here are the directions**:
1. Inhale for 4 seconds (as the circle expands)
2. Hold your lungs full for 4 seconds (as the circle stays fully expanded)
3. Exhale for 4 seconds (as the circle shrinks)
4. Hold your lungs empty for 4 seconds (as the circle is contracted)

That's it!

Repeat for as many times as you need to calm down  :)
